  QANAT Logo — FINALIST 1: "The Geometric Q" (REFINED)
  
  The strongest candidate. A bold Q formed by a thick-stroke circle (bowl)
  with three parallel diagonal lines as the tail — representing three qanat
  channels flowing underground. The tail cuts through the bowl via a mask,
  creating visual integration between letter and metaphor.
  
  REFINEMENTS from brand-kit version:
  - Recentered to true 256,256 center for perfect icon framing
  - Bowl stroke-width increased from 46→48 for better small-size legibility
  - Tail angle adjusted to exactly 42° (golden angle approximation)
  - Channel line spacing tightened for better visual rhythm
  - Rounded line caps for all elements (consistent)
  - Mask gap widened slightly for cleaner separation at small sizes
  
  SCALABILITY: Tested at 16px, 32px, 64px, 256px, 512px, 1024px, 4096px
  VERSATILITY: Available in color, dark, white, single-color variants
